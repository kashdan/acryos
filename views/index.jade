          | The Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) estimated that between 2007 and 2011 the Greenland ice sheet alone, not counting all the peripheral glaciers in Greenland, lost 262 Gt of ice per year. That works out to about 8300 tonnes per second. That means the Greenland ice sheet probably weighs 250,000 tonnes less than when you started reading this report. No wonder we can measure its mass loss by gravitational anomalies. The ice sheet is currently losing mass via both surface runoff (the difference between accumulation and melt) and ice dynamics (the production of icebergs). Our research group estimates that runoff comprised about 61 per cent of the ice sheet’s mass loss, or about 5000 tonnes per second, with iceberg production comprising the remaining 3300 tonnes per second of mass loss. Some big numbers that confirm the Greenland ice sheet is presently raising global mean sea level by about 0.73 mm per year.

          | Presents the latest research on causality, glacial surges, ice-shelf collapses, sea level rise, climate change implications, and more. Features new insights into the implications of climate change on increased melting, collapsing, flooding, methane emissions, and sea level rise. The Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) has a new study in Earth and Planetary Science Letters that looks into the mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet. Our research team uses the “input-output” approach, whereby an estimated iceberg production rate is differenced from an estimated snow accumulation rate. The approach we use was slightly different from previous studies because the ice sheet perimeter across which we observed ice flow or the "flux gate" was relatively far inland. Paper: Alison, I., W.

          | Results of oceanographic measurements carried out, from the sea ice surface in the Tempelfjorden near the Tunabreen front in Svalbard are presented. Two temperature and pressure recorders were deployed on a wire from the ice approximately 300 m from the glacier front. The sampling time interval was 1 s. A pressure recorder was located under them on the bottom with a sampling interval of 6 s. Pressure oscillations on the bottom with a period of 90 s and ice cover oscillations with periods of 10 s and 14 s were recorded. The conclusion is made that the recorded oscillations of pressure in the sea water are related to the glacier microsurges, and the observed profiles of temperature, density, and salinity show the absence or insignificant inflow of fresh water from the glacier in the fjord during the winter season. That means we had to make a different assumption about the vertical velocity profile at the flux gate, as well as account for changes in ice volume between the flux gate and the tidewater glacier grounding lines. Our research team also uses a new combination of satellite-derived ice surface velocity product, airborne radar-derived ice thickness observations and surface mass balance simulations.
