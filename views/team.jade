      p Benefactor at International Glaciological Society (IGS), the entrepreneur and Ph.D. in Geography, geoscience mathematician and glaciologist. Research Scientist & Co-founder at Applied Cryospheric Consulting Corp., Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. His research is focused on Cryosphere of the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, including Arctic and Antarctic land ice and sea ice. Airborne imaging techniques using digital aerial photography and scanning LiDAR and Radar to estimate risk of calving glaciers, ground icebergs and sea ice thickness, drift and mechanical properties of ice. This information is used to check remote sensing data collected by satellites like ICESat, CryoSat-2, TerraSAR-X etc. which is used by other Arctic and Antarctic research programs.
