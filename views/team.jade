      h2 Ph.D. Adam Kashtanov
      p Senior Research Scientist & Co-founder at Acryos Corp. led an incredible 20+ year career as an internationally researcher in geoscience business and Mobile Cyber Security development and and stochastic dynamic programming. Benefactor at International Glaciological Society (IGS), the entrepreneur and Ph.D. in Geography, geoscience mathematician and glaciologist. His research is focused on Cryosphere of the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, including Arctic, Antarctic and High mountain land ice and sea ice. Airborne imaging techniques using digital aerial photography and scanning LiDAR and Radar to estimate risk of Dangerous Erosional and Mass movement processes: earthflow, debris landslide and etc, snow avalanches, calving glaciers, ground icebergs and sea ice thickness, drift and mechanical properties of ice. This information is used to check remote sensing data collected by satellites and others devices which is used by other Climate Change and Social Adaptation research programs.
